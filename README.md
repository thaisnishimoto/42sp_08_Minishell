<h2>
About the Project
</h2>

`Minishell` is a simple Bash implementation that allows users to interact with their operating system through a command-line interface. 

1. **Tokenizer** <br>
The tokenizer is responsible for breaking down user command-line input into meaningful tokens that can be understood by the parser. Tokens typically represent different parts of a command, such as command name, arguments, and operators (like pipes `|`, redirection `>`, `<`, etc.). The tokenizer's output is a sequence of tokens that form the basis for command interpretation. In this step, we also validate the syntax for correctness (e.g., mismatched quotes, invalid token sequence).

3. **Parser** <br>
The parser takes the sequence of tokens generated by the tokenizer and builds a data structure (in our case an abstract syntax tree) that represents the syntactic structure of the command-line input. The parser identifies the relationships between tokens and determines the command structure (e.g., command name, arguments, redirections) and hierarchy. During parsing, we expand variables that are in a command structure.

4. **Executor** <br>
The executor is responsible for taking the parsed command structure and executing it. It starts by handling heredocs inputs, proceedes to file redirections and then it executes the command. Depending on the command type (e.g., internal built-in commands or external executable programs), the executor may handle command execution differently. In the execution phase, we parse the redirections filename to check in case of variable expansion and also remove and handle quotes of command names (splitting if unquoted).

<h2>
Functionality
</h2>

`Minishell` supports the following features:
* Prompt display
* Command history (up and down arrows)
* Syntax verification
* Command search and execution (using a relative or an absolute path)
* Builtin commands:
  * `echo` (with option `-n`)
  * `cd` (with only a relative or absolute path)
  * `pwd` (no options)
  * `export` (no options)
  * `unset` (no options)
  * `env` (no options or arguments)
  * `exit` (no options) 
* Pipes `|` which redirect output from one command to input for the next
* Redirections:
  * `>` redirects output in truncate mode
  * `>>` redirects output in append mode
  * `<` redirects input
  * `<< DELIMITER` opens a heredoc, reads user input until seeing a line containing the `DELIMITER`, and is a way to redirect multi-line input to a command. (it does not update command history)
* Environment variables (i.e. `$USER` or `$VAR`) and token expansions.
  * `$` - followed by a variable name, expands to the environment variable`s value
  * `$?` expands to the exit status of the most recently executed command
  * `~` expands to $HOME variable value
  * `#` - it and all subsequent characters up to the next <newline> are discarded as a comment
  * `Single quotes` prevent interpretation of metacharacters (i.e. echo `$USER` will literally print `$USER`).
  * `Double quotes` prevent interpretation of metacharacters but allow variable expansion (i.e. echo `"< $USER"` will print `<` followed by the value of `$USER`).
  * When a heredoc delimiter is a variable, it is not expanded
  * When a heredoc delimiter is quoted, variables in the input are not expanded
  * When expanded, a variable can be executed (i.e. export `a="echo hello"`, `$a` will execute echo and print hello)
* Signals in interactive mode:
  * `ctrl-c` displays a new prompt line
  * `ctrl-d` exits minishell
  * `ctrl-\` does nothing
* Signals in exec mode:
  * `ctrl-c` displays a new prompt line
  * `ctrl-d` sends an end-of-file to the command
  * `ctrl-\` quits
* Signals inside a heredoc:
  * `ctrl-c` closes heredoc
  * `ctrl-d` closes heredoc with a warning
  * `ctrl-\` does nothing

Usage
</h2>

Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:thaisnishimoto/42sp_08_Minishell.git
```
Compile:
```sh
make
```
To check for memory leaks using valgrind, suppressing the readline library leaks: 
```sh
make leak
```
Run program:
```
./minishell
```
End program:
```
exit
```
